# assessment

This project covers the unit tests for the ReadyForDispatchAPI and ReadyForDispatchApp

Due to time contraints I could not write all tests.

## ReadyForDispatchAPI

## Considerations

I would ensure that code coverage is min. 80% and should cover the testable scenarios in:

-> Receiving the HTTP request
-> Validation of the request and the payload
-> Persisting the payload to the database
-> Sending the dispatch request to the SFTP uploader function

## ReadyForDispatchApp

I would ensure that code coverage is min. 80% and should cover the testable scenarios.
